"""Context-layer audit.

Mechanical drift checks over the instruction-file / MEMORY.md / skills layer of
a consuming repository. Catches the classes of drift that do not need
judgement, so agent attention is spent on the ones that do.

Usage:  python3 context-audit.py [--root PATH] [--scope NAME ...]
                                 [--group-dir NAME ...] [--instruction-file NAME]
                                 [--registry PATH] [--max-age DAYS]
                                 [--no-git] [--all]

A *scope* is a directory carrying its own context pair — an instruction file
(`CLAUDE.md`, or `AGENTS.md` where that is the repository's convention) beside a
`MEMORY.md`. Pass `--scope` once per scope, or pass none and let the audit
discover every immediate subdirectory that carries the pair.

A *grouping directory* is one whose only job is holding scopes. Its name varies
by ecosystem — `projects/`, `packages/`, `apps/`, `services/`, `crates/` — so
pass `--group-dir` once per name in use; the default is `projects`. Pass
`--instruction-file AGENTS.md` where that, rather than `CLAUDE.md`, is the
tree's real instruction file and the other name is only an interop pointer.

Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = findings. Findings are advisory, not policy.
